# phpodcast

## Summary

phpodcast is a simple php program that allows you to server your own podcast from a web server.
It reads a list of files from a predefined directory and uses them to
generate a podcast RSS feed with episodes.

## Setup

The setup for phpodcast is extremely simple:

- Copy these three php files to an accessible location on your web server
- Copy your podcast episodes to another accessible directory on the server
- Go through `config.php` and edit the file as needed

And that's it!

The code uses standard php and has no dependencies.

## Usage

Once your podcast feed and episodes are online, you can submit it to iTunes and other services
so that it can be found in podcast apps, or you can subscribe to it directly with the RSS feed URL.
